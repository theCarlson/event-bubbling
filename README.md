> # JS Event Bubbling

### Simple project to help me better understand JS Event Bubbling
* Open console, click on a div. The **event.target** and **event.currentTarget** are logged to the console. 
* It may be helpful to clear the console after each click to clearly see what is happening.  
* If not clear a quick glance at the index.html file may help also.
